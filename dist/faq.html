                      The Odin Project is for absolute beginners in the world of
                      web development and those who have tried other resources
                      without success. In reality, The Odin Project is for
                      anyone who wants to work as a web developer, do
                      freelancing work, build a startup, or just hack together a
                      homepage for yourself. All the tools you need are here.
                      You should consider yourself fairly competent with
                      personal computers and open to using a non-Windows based
                      Operating System. We’ve built an in-depth curriculum
                      designed to take you 100% of the way to becoming a web
                      developer. Many other resources out there teach you just
                      the basics of programming. With The Odin Project you’ll
                      create your own websites, games, and social media sites.
                      The curriculum has also been designed in a modular
                      fashion, making skimming through lessons a breeze.

                      We won't have any of this 'Learn it all in two days!' BS.
                      You can't start from scratch and learn true web
                      development in such a short period of time and you know
                      it. It's highly unlikely that you'll be employable after a
                      weekend workshop or a one-month part-time course. On the
                      other hand, you don't necessarily need to put in 4 years
                      getting a CS degree. 80% of what they cover won't be used
                      during a typical web developer's early career and it's not
                      necessary to get hired. So why not learn the 20% and learn
                      the rest while you're getting paid on the job? We've
                      essentially distilled down what you most need to learn to
                      hit that employable level, but it's still a healthy dose
                      of learning. Depending how fast you learn, it will take
                      roughly 1000 hours of work to hit that sweet spot. If
                      you're naturally more technical or come from a technical
                      background, it may be a bit faster. If you're less
                      technical or brand new to all this, it will take longer.
                      Don't despair! When you think about it, that's pretty much
                      the same learning curve you had to climb to learn anything
                      worthwhile so far in life.

                      The Odin Project contains three paths for students to
                      choose from: Fullstack Ruby on Rails, Fullstack
                      Javascript, and Frontend only. The Ruby on Rails path
                      gives a general overview of what fullstack is. This is the
                      default path for most beginners. The Javascript path
                      focuses more on the connection between the webpage and the
                      data with Javascript and NodeJS. The Frontend path
                      primarily goes over HTML, CSS and Javascript but no Ruby
                      on Rails. Below are some courses that are included in
                      these curriculums: The Foundations course will give you a
                      chance to explore several of the languages and
                      technologies you’ll need to know on your journey to
                      becoming a web developer. Foundations introduces HTML,
                      CSS, Javascript, Ruby, Rails, Git, databases and more.
                      We’ve also created mini-projects that give you a chance to
                      test your new knowledge by building your own applications
                      and websites! The Odin Project takes a back-to-front
                      approach to learning Ruby on Rails. We start with a strong
                      foundation in Ruby and an understanding of databases
                      before migrating into Ruby on Rails (which is a framework
                      built using Ruby). The Odin Project then delves deep into
                      HTML and CSS, along with Javascript to give you all the
                      tools necessary to make websites flow, load quickly, and
                      look great. Along the way you’ll learn Git and deployment
                      so you can build your own portfolio, collaborate with
                      others, and see your work on the web. Finally, The Odin
                      Project will provide you with opportunities to work with
                      legacy codebases and open-source projects. We’ll also
                      cover areas specifically intended to help when you’re
                      looking for employment.

                      The Odin Project is different from other online programs
                      in that it pulls the best resources from around the web
                      and compiles them to create a complete curriculum. In many
                      other programs the material is formatted to meet their
                      specific curriculum. This means that not all of the
                      lessons are top-notch. The Odin Project sidesteps this
                      downfall by pulling various free resources from around the
                      web and compiles them in one place. The Odin Project also
                      attempts to develop your problem solving skills when it
                      requires you to install programs on your local computer.
                      As developers, programming errors frequently arise and
                      knowing how to decipher error messages is critical. These
                      problem solving skills are frequently ignored by other
                      programs. Lastly, The Odin Project is project based. Other
                      programs require you to simply input the correct answer.
                      It is difficult to retain any knowledge by learning the
                      bare minimum syntax. The Odin Project is designed with
                      projects built from the ground up giving you real-world
                      experience that you can use to build your portfolio and
                      get hired as a web developer!

                      many tech companies and has a strong community of
                      developers who support it. Ruby on Rails lets you deploy a
                      functioning website in hours instead of weeks. Rails also
                      provides a great platform to build the skills you need to
                      carry you to the next phase.

                      You don’t have to! Dive right in, the content is free and
                      available. It’d be best if you started at the beginning
                      and went through in order but everyone’s goals are
                      different so we made the full curriculum available if you
                      want to cherry-pick lessons or projects. However, by
                      signing up you are able to check off completed projects
                      and lessons, easily keeping track of your progress. We
                      don't collect any user data and keep emails to a minimum.
